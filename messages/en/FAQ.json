  "item0-q": "What type of lubricant is used in enclosed gear drives?",
  "item0-a": "A mineral or synthetic oil formulated with EP (Extreme Pressure) additives is generally recommended to withstand high loads and reduce wear.",
  "item1-q": "How should one choose the best lubricant for industrial gearboxes?",
  "item1-a": "Consider the gear type, load, speed, operating temperature, and environment. Select the ISO viscosity specified by the manufacturer, and prioritize EP/AW, anti-corrosion, and anti-foaming additives. Verify seal compatibility and set relubrication intervals according to operating conditions.",
  "item2-q": "Can biodegradable lubricants be used in gearboxes?",
  "item2-a": "Yes. Synthetic or vegetable esters are an option where environmental risk or stringent regulations apply. Verify compatibility with metals and seals, as well as thermal and hydrolytic stability and the manufacturerâ€™s guidance; they are typically more costly and should be monitored for performance."
